# 1. Project Structure Analysis

This document breaks down the current Angular application structure and outlines the proposed Flutter application structure.

## Current Angular Structure Analysis

### Core App Components
- [ ] **App Module**
  - Identify all imports and dependencies
  - Document providers and declarations
  - Note bootstrapping process
- [ ] **Routing Module**
  - Map all routes and their corresponding components
  - Document route guards and resolvers
  - Note any lazy-loaded modules
- [ ] **Navigation System**
  - Analyze menu structure and navigation patterns
  - Document navigation state management
  - Identify navigation-related services
- [ ] **Authentication/Guards**
  - Document authentication flow
  - Map all route guards
  - Identify user roles and permissions
- [ ] **HTTP Interceptors**
  - Document JWT interceptor functionality
  - Analyze error handling interceptors
  - Map date interceptor functionality
- [ ] **Shared Services**
  - Identify and document all shared services
  - Map service dependencies
  - Note singleton vs. provided-in-root services

## Proposed Flutter Structure

### Core App
- [ ] **Main Application Shell**
  - Design app initialization flow
  - Plan theming and global styling
  - Outline error boundaries and fallbacks
- [ ] **Navigation System**
  - Design navigation architecture (nested navigation, tabs)
  - Plan route generation strategy
  - Outline deep linking support
- [ ] **Authentication**
  - Design authentication providers
  - Plan secure storage for tokens
  - Outline user session management
- [ ] **HTTP Client**
  - Plan API client architecture
  - Design interceptors for Flutter
  - Outline error handling strategy
- [ ] **Shared Services**
  - Plan service locator pattern implementation
  - Design dependency injection approach
  - Outline shared utilities structure
- [ ] **Core Dependencies**
  - Map core packages needed
  - Plan versioning strategy
  - Outline platform-specific implementations

## Structure Comparison Checklist

### Angular vs Flutter Components
- [ ] Compare component lifecycle methods
- [ ] Map Angular services to Flutter providers/BLoC
- [ ] Compare routing approaches
- [ ] Analyze state management differences

### Directory Structure Mapping
- [ ] Map Angular module structure to Flutter package structure
- [ ] Design resource organization (assets, fonts, etc.)
- [ ] Plan configuration files location
- [ ] Outline test directory structure

## Next Steps

- Complete the analysis of all Angular components, services, and modules
- Document API endpoints and data models
- Create a detailed mapping of Angular patterns to Flutter equivalents
- Develop a prototype of the core Flutter application structure
